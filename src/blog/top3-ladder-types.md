# Top 3 Ladder Types (Extension, Step, Platform)

Whether you're a roofer, a technician, or just someone doing house repairs, choosing the **right ladder type** can make all the difference. Each ladder is designed for specific tasks and environments — and using the wrong one could lead to accidents or make your work harder.

In this blog post, we’ll break down the **top 3 most common ladder types** — **extension**, **step**, and **platform ladders** — so you can pick the best fit for your job in Nigeria.

---

## 1. **Extension Ladders**

Extension ladders are the go-to for professionals handling **high-reach projects**, especially roofing. They come in two or more sliding sections that extend to give you extra height.

### 🔧 Best For:
- Roofing jobs on bungalows and duplexes  
- Cleaning gutters or solar panel installation  
- Painting multi-story walls  

### ✅ Pros:
- Very tall — can extend up to 30 feet or more  
- Lightweight if aluminum  
- Doesn’t take much space when collapsed  

### ⚠️ Cons:
- Must lean on a wall or surface  
- Not ideal for indoor or short-height work  
- Not self-supporting  

> **Tip:** Always ensure the ladder base is set at the right angle (4:1 ratio) for safety.

## 2. **Step Ladders**

Step ladders are the most common for **everyday indoor and outdoor tasks**. They’re A-shaped and don’t require support to stand.

### 🔧 Best For:
- Indoor ceiling repairs  
- Electrical and lighting work  
- Reaching high shelves or storage  

### ✅ Pros:
- Freestanding — no need for support  
- Comes in various sizes (3ft to 10ft)  
- Easy to carry and store  

### ⚠️ Cons:
- Limited height  
- Not ideal for roofing  
- May feel less stable on uneven floors  

> **Local Hack:** Get a step ladder with **wide rubber feet** if you’re using it on tile or smooth cement.

## 3. **Platform Ladders**

Think of platform ladders as a step ladder upgrade. They have a flat platform at the top step where you can stand comfortably or place tools while working.

### 🔧 Best For:
- Long tasks where you need balance  
- HVAC or plumbing maintenance  
- Indoor ceiling and wall painting  

### ✅ Pros:
- Very stable and secure  
- Great for long-duration standing work
